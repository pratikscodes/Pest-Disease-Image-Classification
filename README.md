## Project Description
Farmers incur drastic economic losses every year due to the various disease that can happen to their crop. Using Deep learning based pest disease image classification can help in the following ways:

- Early detection: By using image classification algorithms, farmers can detect pest and disease outbreaks early on. This can help them take measures to control the spread of the disease, reduce crop damage and improve yield.

- Reduced costs: Traditional methods of detecting pest and diseases involve manual inspection of crops, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Image classification can help reduce these costs by automating the process and making it more efficient.

- Better crop management: By identifying specific pests and diseases affecting their crops, farmers can take targeted measures to control them. This can help reduce the amount of pesticides and other chemicals used, leading to more sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices.

- Improved food security: By improving crop yields and reducing losses due to pest and diseases, image classification can help improve food security, particularly in developing countries where agriculture is a major source of livelihood.

Thus by using AI based tools, pest disease image classification has the potential to revolutionize farming practices, improve yields, reduce costs and improve food security.
